Activity 13 Rubric Requirements

#1: Create and utilize a two-dimensional array to manage a collection of data
A two-dimensional array of 3x3 was used to build the TicTacToe game board.
A random number was generated (0 for O, 1 for X) and the game board was filled with either a 0 or 1.
After each space was filled the game would check for a winner and if a winner could be declared the loop would
terminate and not fill in the rest of the spaces with the random number.
Once a winner could be declared the board would display and a message at the bottom of the board would declare
who won. If the game was a tie then the message would indicae there was a tie.

#2: Use the .NET environment to develop a simple graphical user interface using built-in tools.
Built a 3x3 grid as is standard for a game of TicTacToe in the form builder.
Xs and Os will display within the grid depending on the random value the grid space holds.
Buttons to generate a new game and exit were added
