Activity 12 Rubric Requirements

#1: Process text using string class methods
All contents of the input file are read into a string variable.
The string is checked character by character to determine how many words in the total string end in an
"e" or "t"
Searching for punctuation or whitespace are the delimiters being used to determine the end of a words

#2: Read/Write data from/to a file as part of a solution to a problem
Both read and write are used in the program.
First the string "Don't be late, teatime will not wait!" is written to the "Activity12.txt" file.
The program then reads the "Activity12.txt" file into a string variable so it can be processed by the program
