Activity 15 Rubric Requirements

#1: Create an application that incorporates multiple forms.
Two forms are used: 
EntryScreen - This is the "main" form where all user interaction is handled. When user clicks "Get Lucky Number" button it calls the 2nd form.
LuckyNumber - This is the 2nd form that is displayed when the user clicks "Get Lucky Number" on the EntryScreen form.

EntryScreen -
Uses 3 list boxes for the user to choose their birth month, birth day and to pick a number between 1 and 10.
Based on the birth month and birth day entered, the proper astrological sign is displayed
Using a math formula with some random numbers generated, the user's "lucky number" is calculated and sent to the LuckyNumber form to be displayed.

LuckyNumber -
Called by EntryScreen to display the user's "lucky number" calculated in the EntryScreen form.

#2: At least one control is programmatically populated.
signResultLabel displays the astrological sign associated with the birth month and birth day entered by the user.

#3: At least one control is populated based on a selected item in another control.
Based on the choices made in the birth month and birth day list boxes, the astrological sign is displayed on the EntryScreen form

#4: Programming style, usability, and creativity.
Left to the eye of the beholder.
