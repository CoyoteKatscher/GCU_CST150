Activity 5 Rubric Requirements

#1: Read/Write data from/to a file as part of a solution to a problem.
I created a text text file that would be opened by the open file dialog box.
An output file was created by the program to store the statistics generated by the program.

#2: Select and utilize appropriate looping structures as part of a solution to a problem.
A while loop was used to allow the program to read and process every line of data in the text file.
If/Else statements were used to convert all words to lower case, determine the first and last words alphabetically, and determine the longest word.
A for loop was used to check the current word being processed to determine how many vowels were in the word.
The entire processing portion of the program was in a try/catch structure for error checking.

#3: Use file dialog controls in an application
I used the openFileDialogBox to open the text input text file

#4: Process text using string class methods.
ToLower() was used to convert words with upper case letters to words with all lower case letters.
Compare was used to compare 2 strings to determine alphabetical positions of the strings.
Length was used to determine the length of a string
