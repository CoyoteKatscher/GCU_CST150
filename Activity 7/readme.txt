Activity 7 Rubric Requirements

#1: Select and utilize appropriate looping structures as part of a solution to a problem.
Within the Activity 7 specifications it is noted "You must use a FOR loop to do this"
To meet the requirements I used a for loop to step through each term and do the calculations based on the term count 
for the current iteration of the loop.

#2: Formulate mathematical expressions to solve problems
The Leibniz formula is what was listed in the Activity 7 specifications. 
Using the formula, an if/else structure was used to determine if the current iteration required subtraction or addition. 
The valueOfPI was updated based on which condition was met in the if/else structure.

#3: Use the .NET environment to develop a simple graphical user interface using built-in tools.
CST-150-RS-Activity7Example.docx provided within the Activity 7 specifications was used as the basis of my form.
Based on feedback received I changed the background text color to blue and updated font colors to white so they were readable on the blue background.
Additional buttons were added to make the user interface more useful and clean:
The Clear button will replace any text in the text box with an empty string making it appear the box is cleared out.Additionally, the text label text is reset to the default value.
Once the user is done making calculations the Exit button will exit the application.
