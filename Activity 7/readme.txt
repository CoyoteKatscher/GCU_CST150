Activity 6 Rubric Requirements

#1: Format numeric and text output to meet a specification.
Within the Activity 6 specification it is noted "formatting all numeric output to exactly three decimal places".
To meet the requirements I used the formatting available in the ToString() function of "nx" where x is the number of
decimal places for the output to show therefore I used n3 so the output is formatted to the required three decimal places.

#2: Use exception handling to catch runtime errors.
I used the TryParse() function within an if/else selection structure to handle errors. When a non-double numeric value is entered in the text box, a message box appears stating the inputted value is invalid.

#3: Interface is attractive and uncluttered.
Instead of using Activity 2 as my base, I decided to start from scratch and create a new interface.
Based on feedback received I changed the background text color to blue and updated font colors to white so they were readable on the blue background.
Additional buttons were added to make the user interface more useful and clean. The Clear button will replace any text in the two text boxes with an empty string making it appear the boxes are cleared out. Once the user is done making conversions the Close button will exit the application.
