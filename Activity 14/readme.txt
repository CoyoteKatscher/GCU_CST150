Activity 14 Rubric Requirements

#1: Utilize Radio Buttons in a program.
I created a Group Box control and added 3 Radio Buttons in the Group Box. Using the Group Box ensures
only one Radio Button can be selected at a time
Radio Buttons: White Sub Roll, Wheat Sub Roll, Sourdough Bread

#2: Utilize Check Boxes in a program.
I added 6 Check Boxes in the form. The Check Boxes are being used as toppings choices.
Check Boxes: Cheese, Lettuce, Mayo, Mustard, Pickles, Tomato

#3: Utilize a List Box in a program.
I added a List Box with 4 items. The List Box is being used as a meat choice. Only one item in the List Box
can be selected at any given time.
List Box Items: Ham, Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami

#4: Demonstration and Justification program design choices.
The whole program was to simulate building a sandwich based on a user's preferences.
Once the user selects a meat (List Box), bread (Radio Buttons) and any optional topings (Check Boxes) and
clicks the "Make!" button the program displays their custom made sandwich under the "Your Sandwich" text.

Error checking was implemented as well. The program verifies the user has selected a meat choice and bread choice (mandatory fields). An error message is displayed if one of the choices was not picked.
